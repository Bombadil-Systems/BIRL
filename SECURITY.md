# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue in BIRL itself, email chris@bombadil.systems. I read everything and will respond within 48 hours.

## Scope

BIRL is a security research framework. It is designed to identify parser coverage gaps and test detection boundaries. If you use BIRL and discover a gap in a commercial security product, please follow responsible disclosure with the affected vendor.

## Intended Use

This tool is intended for authorized security testing, research, and education. Do not use it against systems you don't own or have written permission to test.
